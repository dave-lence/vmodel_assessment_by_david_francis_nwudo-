# vmodel_test

## Getting Started
This application was made with Flutter and Dart. Design, concepts and colors were inspired by me.

To get started and run the application on your PC you need to install Flutter, preferably the latest version. To run the application use the following command
##### git pull https://github.com/dave-lence/vmodel_assessment_by_david_francis_nwudo-.git
##### flutter run
The first command is to pull the project from the cloud (GitHub cloud) and the second would start the application on your local machine.

If you want to run the application on a real device without using your local machine, I will attach the APK file below. You can also the download the application from this link 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dUK8P17Sf4LQO-vGiu8GpUgA_RTeX4EL/view?usp=sharing . Its a gooogle drive link where i hosted the application.
### Note
The application is an android application and can only be used on an android phone.

## Using the App on your Phone.
By now you must have installed the application. The purpose of the application is to post, update and delete blogs (Manage blogs).
On landing on the blog list screen, you would be presented with a list of blogs which you can select and read the content inside the blog you selected. You can also edit the blog you selected. 
At the down right of the blog listing screen, there is a button with an add icon (Floating action button) use the button to create a new blog. You would be directed to a new screen conataining text fields so you can type in your blog. 

### Please Note
After posting a new blog, you can or might want to refresh the screen by dragging/swipping the screen down, this would refresh the apk and as well refresh the blog list to have the lastest blog, just like twitter and instagram.

### Deleting a Blog
To delete a blog you would have to swipe left or right on a blog. This would bring out a confirmation dialog asking you if you really want to delete that blog or not.

Thank you.
